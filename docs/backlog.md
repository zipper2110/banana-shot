# Backlog

This file lists the open work. For the steps of a release, see
`release-checklist.md`.

Remove an item when it is done. To change the order of the work, move an item
to a different section.

## Pre-release

Do these items before the first public release.

### B-4 License restriction

- `docs/licensing/elv2-migration-plan.md` has the open license items
  (phase 5, license key functionality, and phase 6, release).
- The license restriction (phase 5) must be in the first release. Check which
  other items must also be in it.

### B-5 First-time hints for new users

- The proposal has 23 one-time hints, with an anchor, a trigger, a text, and
  a priority for each hint:
  [First-time hints for new users](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6ed337ac-c2da-470d-b120-487ad46e118c).
  The review of the proposal is not finished.
- Build the 8 high-priority hints first: 1, 2, 8, 10, 14, 15, 18, 23.
- First replace `PreferencesScoreSettingsHint` with a registry that keeps one
  flag for each hint. More → Settings → "Show all hints again" must reset
  all hints.
- Done when: the high-priority hints show once. After the user closes a
  hint, it does not show again. "Show all hints again" shows the hints again.

### B-6 Better tooltips for new users

- Add more information to the tooltips, so that new users can learn the app.
  B-5 adds one-time hints. This item is about the usual tooltips.

### B-7 Popup window redesign

- Redesign the popup windows.

### B-8 Requests for bug reports and features

- Ask users to send bug reports and feature requests.
- The Contact page already asks for the log files with a bug report.

### B-9 Analytics

- The app code is in `org.litvin.analytics`. The Worker is in
  `analytics-worker`. The Worker does not accept events until
  `ANALYTICS_INGESTION_ENABLED` is `true`.
- Finish the analytics work and turn it on.
